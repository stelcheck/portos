Currently manages:

1. Exposing ports (by detecting exposed ports or configuring port forwarding)
2. Services (auto start services, start stop manually)

### Todo

- [ ] Start on boot: UI implemented but not working
- [ ] Proxying toggle: UI implemented but not working
- [ ] Bubble notification on first start (to show it's running)
- [ ] Right click/exit menu
- [ ] Bug fixing: there are tons
- [ ] Build: it looks like the installed build runs from CLI but not from Windows menu
